# DNS Servers changed? Are you DHCP-enabled? How to set DNS using PowerShell.
    
### When working with DNS changes, here are three PowerShell commands that may be useful:

Cmdlets Used:
`Get-NetIPConfiguration`
`Get-NetIPInterface`
`Set-DnsClientServerAddress`
`Select-Object`

1. Get-NetIPConfiguration

Equivalent to `ipconfig` in Windows CommandLine, checks your current active network configuration, including the DNSServer addresses.

`Get-NetIPConfiguration -all` is equivalent to `ipconfig /all`

(Make note of the result InterfaceIndex and/or InterfaceAlias properties)


2. Get-NetIPInterface

Now that you know your IP Configuration info (e.g., InterfaceIndex 4), use this commandlet to check if your network adapter is DHCP-enabled. Use the Select-Object helper commandlet to control which columns are displayed.

```
Get-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex 4 | Select-Object Ifindex,InterfaceAlias,AddressFamily,DHCP
```

3. Set-DnsClientServerAddress

If your network adapter is not DHCP enabled, you may need to manually set the DNS server address. 

First, set a variable with the new DNS server addresses

```
$newdns = @('111.111.111.123','111.111.111.124')
```

Then, run `Set-NetIPConfiguration` command. Change the InterfaceIndex parameter value as it applies to your system.

```
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex 4 -ServerAddresses $newdns
```
