 5. `Invoke-Command` (*Admin)
 6. `Enable-PSRemoting`, or `winrm quickconfig`
* Admin credentials will be necessary to execute some commandlets

## VSCode
- Free MicroSoft product with lots of extensions
- Native support for PowerShell (.ps1) files, markdown files (.md), and a bunch of other programming/scripting languages
- Smart intellisense, etc.. 
- Version 1.x is DHA-approved, but must disable cloud services, automatic updates, 


## Arrays
Fundamental programming data structure for storing and organizing data

To identify variable type, you can use the built-in method `gettype()`, e.g., `$var.gettype()`

To count how many elements are in an array, use the built-in method `count()` or `length()`, e.g., `$var.count()`

### Creating a simple array 
```
$objs = "1","2","a","b"
```

### Initializing array variable

*INFO: In PowerShell, `$_` is the alias for the object being passed down the pipeline.*

Properly initialized array variable
```
$arr = @()
"1","2","a","b" | Foreach-object {$arr = $arr + $_}
$arr
#output: 1,2,a,b
$arr.count()
#count: 4
```
Otherwise, the "array" will really only be a collection of strings instead of useful objects. 
```
"1","2","a","b" | Foreach-object {$arr = $arr + $_}
$arr 
#output: 12ab
$arr.count()
#Count: 1
```

### Dynamically, used in script: 

Example: List of hostnames in csv format: 

```
Hostname,IPAddress,MACAddress
atlantis,192.168.0.1,00:11:22:33:44:55
galaxy,192.168.0.2,AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
firestorm,192.168.0.3,12:34:56:78:90:AB
mystique,192.168.0.4,CD:EF:01:23:45:67
phoenix,192.168.0.5,89:AB:CD:EF:01:23
serenity,192.168.0.6,F1:23:45:67:89:AB
nova,192.168.0.7,23:45:67:89:AB:CD
nebula,192.168.0.8,56:78:90:AB:CD:EF
lunaris,192.168.0.9,01:23:45:67:89:AB
orion,192.168.0.10,EF:01:23:45:67:89
```

*Tip: In PowerShell, `$arr += $_` is equivalent to `$arr = $arr + $_`*

```
$hostlist = Import-CSV "\\path\to\Hostnames.txt"

#Start Counter
$i = 0 

#Initialize array variable
$FinalOutput = @()

# Iterate through each hosts using foreach{} statement
foreach ($hostpc in $hostlist) {
  
  Write-Host "Processing $($hostpc.Hostname)"

  # Create a new custom object, then add to FinalOutput array
  $objHost = [pscustomobject]@{
    ID = $i
    Hostname = $hostpc.Hostname
    IPV4 = $hostpc.IPAddress
    MAC = $hostpc.MACAddress
    Ping = if(Test-Connection -ComputerName $hostpc.IPaddress -Count 1 -Quiet -ErrorAction 0) {"Online"} else {"Offline"}
    WinRMStatus = [bool](Test-WSman -ComputerName $hostpc.IPaddress -ea 0) 
  }

  # Add object to array
  $FinalOutput += $objHost

  # Increment counter
  $i++
}

#Output Array
$FinalOutput
```

## Remote PowerShell Sessions

### WSMan? WinRM? 

WS-Management (Web Services-Management, WSMan) is a Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) open standard defining a SOAP-based protocol for the management of servers, devices, applications and various Web services. WS-Management provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across the IT infrastructure.

WinRM is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management for Windows systems.

### Requirements: 

1. Administrator privilege (domain managed, or username/password credentials)

2. WinRM service must be running on remote host.

3. Firewall allows connections through ports 5986 (https) and 5985 (http)

### Initial configuration 

Hosts may need to be initialized for Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Execute the following commands to configure standard WinRM service and firewall rules automatically. 

1. In the remote host machine, from an elevated Command prompt: `winrm quickconfig`

2. In the remote host machine, from an elevated PowerShell session: `Enable-PSRemoting`


### Testing if a remote host is configured for remote management. 

1. `Test-WSMan` : Administator credential is not required to run this commandlet. If remote host is configured for remote management via WS-Management standard, the commandlet outputs:

```
Test-WSMan -ComputerName <hostname/IP>

wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd
ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd
ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation
ProductVersion  : OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0 Stack: 3.0
```

2. `Get-Service`: Administator credential is required to run this commandlet against a remote host. 

If WinRM service status is *Running*, then remote host has been configured for remote management. If not, and it needs to be, see [Initial Configuration](#initial-configuration)

```
#Admin required
Get-Service -Name WinRM -ComputerName <hostname/IP>

Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  winrm              Windows Remote Management (WS-Manag...
```

The same commandlet can also be used to Start or Stop the WinRM service remotely.

```
#Admin required
Get-Service -Name WinRM -ComputerName <hostname/IP> | Start-Service
```

```
#Admin required
Get-Service -Name WinRM -ComputerName <hostname/IP> | Stop-Service
```

```
#Admin required
Get-Service -Name WinRM -ComputerName <hostname/IP> | Restart-Service
```

## PSSessions

*Tip*: Simultaneous sessions to the same remote host can be established from multiple PowerShell session terminals. 

All PSSession commandlets:
```
PS H:\> Get-Command -Noun PSSession

Name
----
Connect-PSSession
Disconnect-PSSession
Enter-PSSession
Exit-PSSession
Export-PSSession
Get-PSSession
Import-PSSession
New-PSSession
Receive-PSSession
Remove-PSSession
```

### **Commandlets in focus**



1. **`New-PSSession`**

Use this commandlet to create new PSSessions with an WinRM enabled remote host. 

*TIP: Use `help New-PSSession -online` to view examples and detailed explanation on how to use this powerful commandlet.*

Example: For remote hosts in a domain environment like Active Directory, where administrator credentials are managed within AD. 
``` 
$session1 = New-PSSession -ComputerName <hostname/ip> -Name "Session1"
```

Example: For remote hosts not within a domain environment, passing credentials will be necessary. 

``` 
$session2 = New-PSSession -ComputerName <hostname/ip> -Name "Session1" -Credential $Cred
```

2. `Get-PsSession`

Use this commandlet to get a list of  PSSessions running in the current PowerShell session. 


```
 Id Name            ComputerName    ComputerType    State         ConfigurationName     Availability
 -- ----            ------------    ------------    -----         -----------------     ------------
  1 WinRM1          WindowsServer1  RemoteMachine   Opened        Microsoft.PowerShell     Available
  2 WinRM2          WindowsServer2  RemoteMachine   Opened        Microsoft.PowerShell     Available
```

3. `Enter-PSSession`

Use this commandlet to enter an active PsSession and get a prompt. The prompt will be prefixed by the remote hostname in square brackets. 

This example 
```
Enter-PSSession -Session WinRM1
[WindowsServer1]: PS C:\Users\admin\Documents>
```
