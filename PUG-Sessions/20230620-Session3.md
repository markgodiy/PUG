## VSCode
Free MicroSoft product with lots of extensions
Native support for PS1 files
Native support for markdown files, and a bunch of other programming/scripting languages

## Arrays
Fundamental programming data structure for storing and organizing data

In PowerShell, `$_` is the alias for the object being passed down the pipeline. 

To identify variable type, you can use the built-in method gettype(), e.g., `$var.gettype()`

To count how many elements are in an array, use the built-in method `count()` or `length()`, e.g., `$var.Count()`

Creating a simple array 
```
$objs = "1","2","a","b"
```

```
$objs |  Foreach-object {$arr = $arr + $_}
"1","2","a","b" | Foreach-object {$arr = $arr + $_}
```
